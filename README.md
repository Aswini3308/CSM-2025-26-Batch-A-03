# Revolutionizing Cloud Data Security with Elliptic Curve Cryptography 
Revolutionizing Cloud Data Security with Elliptic Curve Cryptography proposes integrating Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which offers enhanced security with smaller key sizes and superior efficiency. This system will implement advanced role-based and attribute-based authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access and search data. Additionally, it will support automatic updating of audit logs to bolster system integrity and traceability, thus advancing cloud data management by addressing current security and performance gaps.
