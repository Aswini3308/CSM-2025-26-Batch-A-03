# 🌐 Energy-Aware Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks
📌 Project Overview
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of battery-powered sensor nodes deployed to monitor environmental or physical conditions. One of the major challenges in WSNs is limited energy availability, which directly impacts network lifetime.This project implements an Energy-Aware Clustering and Routing Algorithm using Java-based simulation to reduce energy consumption and improve overall network performance.
🎯 Objectives
Reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes
Extend the lifetime of the wireless sensor network
Balance energy usage among sensor nodes
Minimize the number of dead nodes
Improve data transmission efficiency
🧠 Key Features
Energy-aware cluster formation
Residual energy-based Cluster Head (CH) selection
Data aggregation at cluster heads
Efficient routing to the base station
Performance comparison with existing protocols (LEACH, CBCCP)
